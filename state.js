    //  A forested area is in the surrounding area.
    //  Cut it down to make space for more housing
    //  or
    //  build higher density city? "

    // "Your community is experiencing blackouts.
    //  There isn't enough energy to meet your needs.
    //  What kind of fuel would you like to use?
    //   A. Nuclear
    //   B. Coal
    //   C. Wind Turbine"

    // Option 3:
    // "Your community needs food.
    //  How will you feed your people?
    //   A. Fish
    //   B. Raise Livestock
    //   C. Farm

    // Question Order
// Housing is needed (“People are coming”)
// Cut down forest ⇒ Fragmentation
// Increase city density ⇒ Urban quality goes down (river pollution, etc.)

// Power is needed (“Our infrastructure can’t cope”)
// Nuclear ⇒ Waste storage, decreased land quality
// Coal ⇒ Decreased air quality
// Wind turbines ⇒ Decreased birds, decreased recreation

// Food is needed (“Feed us”)
// Fish farm ⇒ bad river--instantly
// Livestock ⇒ leaching

// Recreation is needed (“Now we need fun”)
// Forest ⇒ less farms, less food
// Swim in the river ⇒ Worse river quality
// Denser city ⇒ Pollution
